# Composite Design Pattern in C#

The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to create a tree-like structure of objects, treating individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Example

In the `Program.cs` file, you can find a sample usage of the Composite pattern. It demonstrates how to create a composite structure of components, where both leaf and composite objects can be used interchangeably.

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create leaf components
        var leaf1 = new Leaf();
        var leaf2 = new Leaf();
        var leaf3 = new Leaf();

        // Create composite components and add leaf components to them
        var composite1 = new Composite();
        composite1.Add(leaf1);
        composite1.Add(leaf2);

        var composite2 = new Composite();
        composite2.Add(leaf3);

        // Create a higher-level composite by adding other composite components
        var composite = new Composite();
        composite.Add(composite1);
        composite.Add(composite2);

        // Execute operations on the composite hierarchy
        composite.Operation();
    }
}
```

This code demonstrates how to create a hierarchical structure of objects using the Composite pattern.

## Benefits

### 1. Hierarchical Structures

The Composite pattern allows you to create complex hierarchical structures of objects, which is useful for representing part-whole relationships in your application.

### 2. Uniform Treatment

Both individual objects (leaf components) and compositions of objects (composite components) can be treated uniformly. This simplifies client code and promotes flexibility.

### 3. Scalability

You can easily add new types of components to the hierarchy without changing existing code, making your codebase more scalable and maintainable.

### 4. Encapsulation

Each component knows how to perform its operation, encapsulating the behavior and reducing code duplication.

## Drawbacks

### 1. Complexity

The Composite pattern may introduce additional complexity, especially if you have a deep hierarchy with numerous components.

### 2. Performance Overhead

Traversing a deep composite structure may incur a performance overhead due to the recursive nature of the pattern.

### 3. Limited Type Checking

Since leaf and composite objects share the same interface, you may need to implement additional type-checking logic in your code to differentiate between them.

Happy Coding!
